### What I learned

I learned how to create lists and how to manipulate on them.How to close open lines when customer are clicking on close one.



```Javascript
for(let i = 0; i<hiddenTexts.length; i++){
                hiddenTexts[i].style.display ='none'
            }

```


### Continued development
 
It was another great project and development for me.Now i am looking to do as much as possible projects like this to feel more and more comfortable and self-confident and then i am going to use back-end development and work with servers and connect front and back sides to each other.
